<h1 align="center">Aryabhata's legacy</h1>
<h3>Aryabhatta died in 550 CE in Patliputra only. The contributions made by Aryabhatta are still used in today’s times. Go through Aryabhatta’s work that is still practised. 

Aryabhata’s astronomical calculating methods are used in the Islamic world to calculate dates for calendars.

Trigonometric tables are used to compute numerous Arabic astronomy tables.

Aryabhatta’s definitions of cosine, sine, versine and inverse sine impacted the development of trigonometry mathematics. Moreover, he was also the first to give sine and versine (1 cos x) tables in 3.75° intervals from 0° to 90°, with 4 decimal places of precision.</h3>
<h1>Contribution of Aryabhatta to Mathematics</h1> 
<h3>Aryabhatta made several contributions to Mathematics inventions and theories. Due to his significant contribution and achievement in mathematics, he is also called The King of Indian Mathematics. Some of the important discoveries he made in the mathematics field are: 

The place value system and zero

Trigonometry,

Algebra,

Approximation of pi π,
 
Indeterminate equations</h3>

<h1>Aryabhatta Place of Birth and Education 
<h3>Aryabhatta was born in Pataliputra, which in present times is in Patna, Bihar state, in the year 476. It is believed that he completed his studies in Kusumapura. Aryabhata was the head of a Kusumapura institution (kulapa). Aryabhata was also the head of the Nalanda University, Bihar, because the university was located near Patliputra and housed an astronomical observatory</h3>
